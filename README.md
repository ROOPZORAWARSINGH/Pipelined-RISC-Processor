# Verification-of-a-Pipelined-RISC-Processor

## 📌Step 1: Understanding the Pipelined RISC Processor

🔹 What is a Pipelined RISC Processor?
A pipelined RISC processor executes multiple instructions simultaneously by breaking down execution into five stages:

Instruction Fetch (IF) – Fetches instruction from memory.

Instruction Decode (ID) – Decodes the instruction and reads registers.

Execute (EX) – Performs ALU operations.

Memory Access (MEM) – Loads/stores data from memory.

Write-Back (WB) – Writes results to registers.

🔹 Challenges in Pipeline Execution

Data Hazards – When one instruction depends on the result of another.

Control Hazards – Due to branches and jumps affecting the instruction flow.

Structural Hazards – Occurs when resources (like memory or registers) are used by multiple instructions at once.




## 📌 Step 2: Verification Plan


✔️ What Needs to Be Verified?

Instruction Execution – Ensure all instructions work correctly.

Pipeline Control Logic – Verify stalls, forwarding, and flush mechanisms.

Hazard Detection & Resolution

Data Hazards (RAW, WAR, WAW)

Control Hazards (Branch prediction, delay slots)

Structural Hazards (Conflicts in memory/registers)

Coverage Metrics

Code Coverage – Ensure all RTL branches are tested.

Functional Coverage – Check different hazard scenarios.

✔️ Test Cases to Cover

✅ Basic ALU operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.)

✅ Load/Store operations

✅ Branching and Jump instructions

✅ Data forwarding and pipeline stalls

✅ Memory access latencies




## 📌 Step 3: UVM Testbench Architecture

A Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench will be used, consisting of:


Driver – Sends instructions to the processor.

Monitor – Observes and logs responses.

Scoreboard – Compares expected vs. actual results.

Coverage Collector – Ensures all scenarios are tested.
